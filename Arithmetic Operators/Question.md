### Task

The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN, `a` and `b`.  
Add code to print three lines where:

1. The first line contains the **sum** of the two numbers.  
2. The second line contains the **difference** of the two numbers (`a - b`).  
3. The third line contains the **product** of the two numbers. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
### Example
```py
8
-2
15
```
## Input Format

The first line contains the first integer, `a`.  
The second line contains the second integer, `b`. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
### Constraints
1 ≤ *a* ≤ 10^10
1 ≤ *b* ≤ 10^10

## Output Format

Print the three values as explained above, each on its own line. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## Sample Input
```py
3
2
```
## Sample Output
```py
5
1
6
```
### Explanation 
3 + 2 = 5
3 - 2 = 1
3 * 2 = 6
