# Python If-Else (HackerRank)

Given an integer, n, perform the following conditional actions:

- If n is odd, print "Weird".
- If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print "Not Weird".
- If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print "Weird".
- If n is even and greater than 20, print "Not Weird".

## Input Format
A single line containing a positive integer, n.

## Constraints
1 <= n <= 100

## Output Format
Print either "Weird" or "Not Weird" on a single line.

## Sample Input 0
```py
3
```
## Sample Output 0
```py
Weird
```

## Sample Input 1
```py
24
```

## Sample Output 1
```py
Not Weird
```

## Explanation
- For n = 3: n is odd, so print "Weird".
- For n = 24: n is even and greater than 20, so print "Not Weird".
